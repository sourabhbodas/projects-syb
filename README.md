projects-syb
============

This is the repository for tutorials and open-source projects written in C/C++ with OpenCV and/or PCL used.


--- 
I cannot upload most of my code I have worked on since it is developed under NDA with the client / people I work for. But from time to time, I will upload bits of code that I can recreate and commit in OpenSource domain. Keep an eye mainly for the AI-OpenTTD folder, because I will soon release some of the first working AI-algorithms on it. I will try my best to test them and upload them soon.
